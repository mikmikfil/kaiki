### #3 - CI workflow: Pint, PHPStan, Pest on SQLite plus MySQL 8 and Redis

Five jobs on every pull request and every push to `main`: `lint`, `static-analysis`, `test-sqlite`, `test-mysql`, and a `ci-passed` aggregate so branch protection needs one required check and cannot silently miss a job added later. PHP 8.4 declared once in workflow-level `env` (ADR-0014 Option B). Composer installs cached on `composer.lock`.

`test-mysql` runs MySQL 8 and Redis 7 service containers, migrates from scratch, and runs the suite with cache, queue and session all on Redis so those code paths are exercised somewhere (ENV-1). Required on every PR, not nightly - ADR-0006 leans on it as the only place real parallelism is tested.

Two problems were found and fixed while building it. `SmokeTest` asserted `config('database.default') === 'sqlite'`, which would have failed the MySQL job for entirely the wrong reason; it now asserts the `.env.example` contract instead, which is what ENV-17 actually requires and holds on both engines. And the `mysql` group could have reported green without ever touching MySQL - PHPUnit *should* let the job environment win over `phpunit.xml`, but "should" is not evidence, so the group's test now asserts the driver really is `mysql` and CI fails on three separate shapes: no summary, a summary containing `skipped`, or a summary without `passed`. This matters well beyond this issue, because the overselling concurrency test joins that group in M2 and can only ever run there.

Also adds `docs/BUILD-LOG.md` - what has been built and the evidence it works, with the real command output rather than the intended output.

### #2 — Quality toolchain: Pint, PHPStan 6 with Larastan, Pest groups and the Composer scripts

Wired the full quality gate. `pint.json` uses the Laravel preset plus `declare_strict_types`, `strict_comparison`, `strict_param` and sorted imports; `phpstan.neon` runs level 6 with Larastan at `phpVersion: 80400` over `app`, `config`, `database`, `routes` and `tests`, with **no baseline** and `packages/wordpress-plugin` excluded because the plugin targets PHP 8.1 for operator hosting (ARC-9). Applying Pint reformatted the framework skeleton, which is the bulk of this diff.

The ENV-15 Composer scripts are in place: `setup`, `dev`, `test`, `test:fast`, `test:mysql`, `lint`, `lint:test`, `analyse`, `stan` and `ci`, each with a `scripts-descriptions` entry. `package.json` carries the seven ENV-16 npm script names as announced stubs so #3 and #4 have something to call before M3 and M4 fill them in.

`tests/Unit/ToolchainTest.php` guards the tooling itself: that the `fast` group runs, that a `mysql`-tagged test is excluded from `composer test`, that `Carbon::setTestNow` freezes time (TST-9), and that the suite runs in UTC.

**A real bug the guard test caught immediately:** Pest ignores a comma-separated `--exclude-group`. `--exclude-group=mysql,chromium,external` silently excluded nothing, so the MySQL-only test ran and passed locally — exactly the false green that ENV-11 exists to prevent. The flag is now repeated per group, and `composer test` correctly runs 8 of 9 tests while `composer test:mysql` runs the 1.

Two PHPStan findings were fixed at the source rather than suppressed: `$this->get()` inside a Pest closure is untypeable, so the smoke test now uses the `Pest\Laravel\get` function helper.

The §16 hooks deferred from #1 now live in `.claude/settings.json`: `PostToolUse` on Edit/Write runs Pint on the touched file when it is PHP and `vendor/bin/pint` exists, and `Stop` runs `composer test:fast` and prints a one-line result. There is no `jq` on this machine, so both parse the hook payload with PHP, which the project guarantees. Both were pipe-tested against synthesised payloads and re-verified verbatim from the stored JSON.

### #1 — Laravel 12 skeleton, SQLite local stack, `composer setup`

Scaffolded the application from an empty repository: Laravel 12.68 on PHP 8.4, with the local runtime contract fixed to SQLite at `database/database.sqlite` and cache, queue and session on the `database` driver, mail on `log`, and `APP_TIMEZONE=UTC` (storage is always UTC; display timezone is per tenant). `composer setup` takes a clean checkout to a migrated, seeded, asset-built application in one command with no manual step, and there is deliberately no `Makefile` and no root `docker-compose.yml`.

Added the `app/Domain/{Catalog,Availability,Pricing,Booking,Payments,Compliance,Notifications,Branding,Import}` layout with an `Actions` directory in each, plus `app/Enums`. `tests/Feature/SmokeTest.php` asserts the app boots, `GET /` is 200, the timezone is UTC, the database is SQLite, every bounded context exists, and no local Docker or make entry point has crept in.

Two deviations from the issue as written, both deliberate: **Pest was pulled forward from #2** so the smoke test is not written in PHPUnit and rewritten a day later — #2 keeps Pint, PHPStan and Larastan. **`laravel/sail` was removed** from the skeleton's dev dependencies, since it is a local Docker tool and local development here is native (ENV-3, ENV-4).

Also needed, outside the repository: nine PHP extensions were commented out in the Windows `php.ini` — `fileinfo`, `pdo_sqlite`, `sqlite3`, `zip`, `gd`, `intl`, `exif`, `sodium`, `pdo_mysql`. Without `pdo_sqlite` the local stack cannot run at all. Documented in `README.md`.

### Project foundation

`CLAUDE.md`, eleven subagent definitions in `.claude/agents/`, and four slash commands in `.claude/commands/`. The §16 hooks are deferred to #2, where the toolchain they invoke actually exists.

`docs/spec.md` (~340 numbered requirements), `docs/data-model.md` (56 tables, four state machines), `docs/api.md` (17 endpoints, 60 schema components), and 23 accepted ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Thirty-seven issues for M0 and M1.
